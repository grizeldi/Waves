# Waves
Once done, Waves will be a 3 band waveform viewing application, written in Rust.

The idea was created after I got too used to staring at 3 band (low, mid, high) waveforms in DJ software, so it now feels wrong looking at flat waveforms commonly found in DAW software.
3 band waveforms make it much easier to see at a glance what is going on in the track at a particular point in time.
Because of all of this, I decided to make a standalone application just for checking waveforms.

It's also my Rust learning project, so it's most likely full of bad practices and beginner stupid decisions.
But hey, can't learn without making mistakes.
